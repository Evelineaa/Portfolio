            <p>Welcome!</p>
            <p>Feel free to dive in and meet my personality from this website. 
               You’ll find my work experience, education, interests, and a couple photos of my life.</p>

            <p> I’m an information and communication technology engineering student. Who is interested in learning and seeing life in a new way.
                I am interested in different kinds of opportunities and that’s why I rarely say “no”. 
                By nature, I’m a perky, active and dedicated self-improver. I always do my work carefully and precisely.
                I've also been used to work with different kinds of people, which has taught me customer service importance.</p>
